# Arkanoid Game

Welcome to the Arkanoid game! This classic game has been reimagined and developed using the Java programming language, bringing endless hours of fun and excitement. In this Arkanoid-style game, players can enjoy smashing bricks, maneuvering the paddle, and collecting power-ups in a visually engaging environment.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Experience the nostalgic joy of breaking bricks using a bouncing ball and a paddle.
- **Observer Pattern:** The game incorporates the observer pattern, enhancing modularity and maintainability. Observers efficiently monitor and respond to state changes, making the game design more scalable.
- **Interactive Environment:** Engage with a dynamic game environment where bricks shatter upon impact, providing a satisfying gaming experience.
- **Power-ups:** Discover various power-ups that enhance gameplay, adding strategic depth and excitement to every level.

## How to Play

- **Controls:** Use the keyboard (arrow keys or A/D keys) to move the paddle horizontally. The goal is to bounce the ball off the paddle to break the bricks above. Avoid letting the ball fall off the screen; otherwise, you'll lose a life.
- **Brick Colors:** Different colored bricks require multiple hits to break. Plan your moves strategically!
- **Power-ups:** Some bricks contain power-ups. Catch these power-ups with your paddle to gain special abilities, such as larger paddle, multi-ball, or shooting abilities.
- **Winning:** Clear all the bricks on the screen to advance to the next level. The game becomes progressively challenging as you advance through the levels.

## Observer Pattern Implementation

The observer pattern is utilized to enhance the game's modularity and maintainability. This design pattern allows components of the game to observe and react to changes in the game state, ensuring a flexible and robust architecture. For example, observers can monitor the number of lives, score, and power-ups collected, enabling dynamic updates to the user interface and game logic.

Enjoy the game, and happy smashing!
